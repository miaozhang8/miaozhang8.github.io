I am a postdoctoral researcher at Simon Fraser Uinversity, working with Prof. [Jiangchuan Liu](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~jcliu/) on Multimedia Networking. 

Prior to this, I received my Ph.D. degree in Computing Science from Simon Fraser University, supervised by Prof.  [Jiangchuan Liu](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~jcliu/), my M.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. [Zhi Wang](http://pages.mmlab.top), and my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Sichuan University. 

My research interests include cloud and edge computing, multimedia systems, and multimedia applications.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
